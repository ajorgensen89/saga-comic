                <p>He is known as an American comic book and television writer and after years of Saga

                    Issue,
                    must of been a tough decision.
                    Due to the top releases of comic books and graphic novels coming on to the scene in 2018,
                    it was decided to post-pone the release of Saga issues 55-60 untill now.</p>

                <p>Deciding along side the writer of the Saga comic book series, that a hiatus, was in the best
                    interest of it's release,
                    she fills our vision of new characters once again. The Saga series might follow a family and
                    their
                    young daughter but that doesn't mean the imagary holds back in anyway.
                    Violence, gore, pleasure and pain can be seen throughout her illustrations bringing the emotions
                    of
                    the quests of these
                    characters to life.</p>


                <p>Her illustrations can be seen, along side others, for pieces of work including:</p>
