        COMIC KNOWLEDGE
<p>Some of you maybe asking..  What part do I read first? An why should I be reading THIS comic?
To try and break it down for you in the briefest description carry on reading...

Each comic is rereferred to as an 'Issue' as released, which can seem pretty small until added to the other releases. 
And that.. is when the magic happens.
Each Issue becomes a chapter in a Volume. Each 6 Issues of the gripping Saga story make this Volume.
Newly released in August 2019, to continue the Saga graphic novel story has been a Compendium. 
We were graced with this Compendium which contained ALL volumes 1-9, that were available to this point.</p>

NOW.. 
<p>Since being away and patiently awaiting the outcome of the partnership of Alana and Marko, along with their beloved daughter .. Hazel, we can continue the story with Issues #55-60 - New in 2022!</p>

SAGA'S STORYLINE
<p>Alana and Marko's forbidden new love in a ancient world full of war and separation, sent them on their epic exploration for a new place for their newborn to thrive in away from the Galactic War surrounding them.
Both soldiers, fighting for what they believe to be right, find love, solace and a precious new goal.
Their baby girl. 
Unknown in this new life, this baby girl was connected to both sides of the war and is now being hunted across space and worlds unknown with only her parents to protect her.</p>

<p>These comics are full of life, from worlds you can not imagine and surprising characters who are rude, gory, sexy and just damn good hunters.
The narration follows the little girl as she tells the story of her parents and growing up to learn how to fit into this World, who she learns from, who can protect her and who she will have to hunt.</p>
