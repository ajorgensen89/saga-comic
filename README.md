## User experience	
The general experience should allow the audience to briefly understand how Comics are put togther and read. Then, I have impletmented a large portion of the website to the New Comic Issues this year so they easily avaliable to notice. 
Information can be found about the hiatus both the Writer and Illustrator for the Comic took and a link to find more information is avaiable from the website. Including, the Pulisher of this particular Comic book Series.
An easy subscribtion form can be found to sign up for future details and the footer contains links to look further in their Social aspects and purchasing the Comics themselves.

### **Properties continued throughout website.**
Border-radius continued throughout the webpage for a 'round world' effect.

Pixels height of 10px's increments over the webpage.

Padding increased in 2px increments used where necessary (e.g. 2px, 4px, 6px)

### Volume 1-9.

Table introduced for this section to show information about their previous releases however, this was not the main focus of the website so thought a simple table of 
information was a good display method.

## Design
### Colour Scheme
The beige to orange colour field continued down into the rest of the page, was used as a subtle hint to the colours in the characters clothing on the landing page image, aswell as the main 'Saga' title in the image.

Colours over page:
* rgba(240, 209, 178, 0.9) (Beige)
* rgb(238, 125, 13) (Orange)
* rgb(29, 7, 51) (Dark Purple, almost black)

The last image which is the background to the Form, is an image used from the Final Chapter of the Comic they released in 2018 before the hiatus. I felt this was a subtle ending to the webpage.

### Typography
Font used from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website.
The two I choose has subtle differences, giving the paragraphs a font of 'Noto Serif' a more 'floaty' look compared to the more basic fuller rounded main font 'Varela Round'.
