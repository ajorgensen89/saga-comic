USE OF README.md - keeps deleting my input. I have used 'git add README.md' but I seem to be getting it wrong.
Pixels height - in 10px's.
Errors - files and folders correction.
Heading position - position along top of page better using line-height. 
Improve position of h1 and h1 ~ p to each other.
Removed and change heading titles.
Issue centering Background image to text - used display: flex instead.
Change font text.

Issues with setting background image using code from Love Running.
Atempted positioning using 'position relative and position absolute' in child and parent elements.
Tried using the method shown below but had forgotten the 'overflow: hidden;' style declaration.
It hadnt set the height to the size i wanted so i put that it myself.
#form-set {
    background-image: url('../images/red2.jpg');
    background-color: rgb(132, 24, 24);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: center;
    background-size: cover;
    width:  100%;
    height: 700px;
    overflow: hidden;
}
